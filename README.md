ECPEC (Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations)
=========

## Overview
>In this repo, we put the data and code of a new task named emotion-cause pair extraction in conversations. The target of this ECPEC task is to extract all the possible emotion-cause pairs in conversations. 
> We build a new dataset entitled ConvECPE on the basis of IEMOCAP dataset. Besides, we also developed a two-step baseline model for ECPEC task. In the first step, all the possible emotion and cause utterances are jointly extracted. After that,
> the extracted emotion and cause utterances are paired into emotion-cause pairs for final binary classification.

This is the code for JointEC framework. It consists of four documents including source dataset, Joint-Xatt(step1 model), Joint-GCN(step1 model) and Joint-EC(step 2 model).

Detailed description of this project will come soon...
