1,sadness,sadness,What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
2,sadness,sadness,He saw it.
3,sadness,sadness,He was out here when it broke.
4,sadness,sadness,Around Four this morning and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.
5,sadness,sadness,I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.
6,sadness,sadness,Did you talk to him?
7,sadness,sadness,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
8,sadness,sadness,He cried hard.
9,sadness,sadness,I could hear him right through the floor of my room.
10,sadness,sadness,He is thinking about him again.
11,sadness,sadness,It's getting just like after Larry died he's having dreams he's walking around at night.
12,sadness,sadness,I guess he is.
13,sadness,sadness,What's the meaning of that?
14,sadness,sadness,I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.
15,sadness,sadness,Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.
16,sadness,sadness,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
17,frustrated,frustrated,No um I don't want to argue with him but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.
18,frustrated,frustrated,Why shouldn't he dream about him walk around during the night looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had any for years now?
19,frustrated,frustrated,We have to say it to him!
20,angry,angry,For God's sake mom three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!
21,frustrated,frustrated,To you it is and to me but not to your father.  Now look you can talk yourself  blue in the face but there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?
22,frustrated,frustrated,Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.
23,frustrated,frustrated,All right All right mom.  Listen!
24,sadness,sadness,You know why I asked Annie here don't you?
25,frustrated,frustrated,You know.
26,null,null,Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?
27,null,null,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
28,frustrated,frustrated,You know that's not just my business.
29,frustrated,frustrated,So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?
30,frustrated,frustrated,I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.
31,frustrated,frustrated,Now Chris you can go on from there but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do because I don't.
32,frustrated,frustrated,I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life time after time after time.
33,null,null,Well you're a considerate fellow there's nothing wrong with that.
34,angry,angry,To hell with that!
35,null,null,Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?
36,null,null,Well how did you know that she will go along with it I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?
37,null,null,The trouble is you don't see enough women you never have
38,frustrated,frustrated,So what I'm not fast with women.
39,null,null,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
40,frustrated,frustrated,Because it is.
41,frustrated,frustrated,I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here the easiest when I think of somebody for my wife I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?
42,frustrated,frustrated,No I don't want a diagram but Chris your father thinks Larry's coming back.
43,sadness,sadness,You marry his girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father do you know?  I don't.
44,frustrated,frustrated,All right then Mom.
45,frustrated,frustrated,I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here I'm set to get out.
46,angry,angry,What the hell is this?
47,frustrated,frustrated,I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe maybe New York?
48,angry,angry,Are you crazy?
49,frustrated,frustrated,Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?
50,angry,angry,The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?
51,frustrated,frustrated,Don't- you you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!
52,angry,angry,All right!  But don't think like that because I mean what the hell did we do all this for Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!
53,frustrated,frustrated,I don't understand you do I?
1,null,null,D.S.L. Extreme can I help you?
2,frustrated,frustrated,Hi I need- I need some help.  I've been transferred to like eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.
3,null,null,This happens every two weeks?
4,frustrated,frustrated,Yeah.  That my service just goes out.
5,null,null,You've lost your connection.
6,frustrated,frustrated,yeah.
7,null,null,okay.
8,frustrated,frustrated,And I'll reset the IP address.  I will do like you know direct connect the modem to my computer and then reset everything and then put the router back in. And-
9,null,null,Hmm.  Mmm.
10,frustrated,frustrated,Is not It it It will work again for like a week and then it goes out again.
11,null,null,Has somebody tried to pin your site?
12,null,null,Uh yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.
13,null,null,Okay. Um-  Well I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?
14,null,null,Pretty much yeah - I don't know if it's like bad phone lines or something.
15,null,null,Well you know what does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L. right?
16,null,null,Hmm. Mmm.
17,null,null,Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable you know travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean is it --
18,null,null,yeah.
19,null,null,It goes- It goes like through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.
20,null,null,Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know disrupted by you know the cable being squished.
21,null,null,Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection but it will be bad off and on.
22,null,null,Well I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do too?  Like I'll go through and check the line throughout the house but --
23,null,null,Yeah well absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off okay.  Can you go down to your start button?
24,null,null,Uh huh.
25,null,null,Okay And uh- go ahead and click on run.
26,null,null,All right.

34,null,null,Uh it it's like a bunch of different letter and numbers and stuff.
35,null,null,Okay Okay And Um- letters and numbers and stuff.  Uh- Can you - Can you just type in IP address search? And hit enter.
36,null,null,Uh huh Okay.
37,null,null,Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?
38,null,null,Uh yeah looks -- no no.  It's set to zeros.
39,null,null,It's set to zeros.  Okay maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.
40,null,null,Well if it does happen again let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --
41,null,null,Of course.  we seriously- Yeah I mean obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.

14,frustrated,frustrated,Well okay well First off fine fine fine.  Let's see first off um- yeah my bill's wrong.
15,angry,angry,Like I know I paid last month but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.
16,null,null,Okay so where? okay all right so where did you uh- locate your your bill?
17,frustrated,frustrated,I got it in the mail.
18,null,null,In the mail?
19,frustrated,frustrated,yeah
20,null,null,So is it is- is it at all possible that maybe this statement is just old and that the transaction hadn't been processed yet?
21,frustrated,frustrated,Well when I look online it says it says that I was charged a late fee so I'm assuming that I paid on your web site-
22,null,null,Okay.
23,frustrated,frustrated,like I paid right through your own company before my due date but it's still and it even shows my payment there and then it charged me the late fee afterwards.
24,null,null,Okay.
25,null,null,Okay so I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on maybe we can...
26,frustrated,frustrated,Okay.
27,null,null,if I call it up on the screen.
28,null,null,Okay great go ahead.
29,null,null,So in the database it looks as though um there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before but I do see that you paid the what can you tell me the amount what was the amount?
30,frustrated,frustrated,It was one ninety eight sixty three. I paid the minimum.
31,null,null,Okay I do see that on here and it says that um it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-
32,null,null,Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions things happens. so um-
33,null,null,No No No I am grateful.
34,null,null,Yeah we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.
35,null,null,Did they take-
36,null,null,You do the direct the direct it um- it's taking right out of your bank account correct?
37,null,null,Yes yes exactly.
38,null,null,Yeah so- That --that did go through.
39,null,null,Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?
40,null,null,Um- I can try to do that for you certainly.
41,frustrated,frustrated,Because I paid it on time.
42,null,null,Right right and since--yeah since it was just a computer glitch then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee then you should just call back and we'll have that.
43,null,null,Right.
44,frustrated,frustrated,Yeah but if I call back I'll have to go through this whole rigmarole again. and try to get a hole or someone.
45,null,null,Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.
46,null,null,yeah.

24,null,null,I just don't.
25,excited,excited,Honey this is a natural phenomenon. I mean  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.
26,excited,excited,Think about people in Kansas they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.
27,frustrated,frustrated,Pass up what?  Its little fish one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
28,excited,excited,Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.
29,excited,excited,This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah
30,frustrated,frustrated,What are you so excited about?  I mean it's not--it's not rocket science we are talking about its fish.  Its fish nobody even eats.
31,excited,excited,Okay but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.
32,excited,excited,There's There's mystery here and magic.  A little bit of the unexplainable.  I can't understand how you could not be interested.

39,excited,excited,Oh this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world.  I mean think about this. I know you are not interested but think about this for a second.
40,excited,excited,Somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.
41,excited,excited,It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.
42,excited,excited,They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.
43,excited,excited,Well So what do you think?

67,null,null,That's rough.  I'm really sorry Ryan.
68,null,null,Well um is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?
69,frustrated,frustrated,No I just showed that for you [garbage].
70,null,null,Okay.  Well that's good.  Yeah I mean you're you're- when you're happy you're a pretty personable guy.  And I don't --I don't
71,frustrated,frustrated,I like to think so.
72,null,null,I can't see where the issue would be. so
73,frustrated,frustrated,see.
74,angry,angry,Yeah well thanks for your help.
75,sadness,sadness,I'll need it.
1,null,null,Can I help you?
2,null,null,Oh this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..
3,null,null,Right but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.
4,null,null,Yeah.  So I can't -- I can't do anything-
5,null,null,No but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --
6,frustrated,frustrated,What's the difference?  What's the difference between that form and this form?
7,frustrated,frustrated,Sir don't get an attitude with me.
8,angry,angry,I'm not getting a -- well you wait in this line and not get an attitude.
9,null,null,No I understand and there are a lot of people here.  But what I'm telling you is that it's different for different states and since your getting a new license in the state of California -- You have to fill out a different form than you did.
10,frustrated,frustrated,Well then when I showed them my I.D. before and I said I had to get a new I.D why didn't they tell me to fill out the right form?
11,frustrated,frustrated,I don't know.  I don't know who told you.  It wasn't me.
12,frustrated,frustrated,Well it was this girl standing right next to you.  Can we ask her why she didn't let me fill out the right form?
13,frustrated,frustrated,You- You can ask her if you want but she's busy and she probably won't answer you.
14,null,null,I know.
15,frustrated,frustrated,Sir you- I mean
16,frustrated,frustrated,Do you know how long it's gonna take me to start all over and fill out the new form?
17,frustrated,frustrated,You can waist as much as you want
18,null,null,Yeah.  I know it's gonna take a minute.  But you-- so you might as well get started now.
19,frustrated,frustrated,Might as well get started now? but Just take this one.
20,frustrated,frustrated,I can't take this one sir. this is the wrong form.
21,frustrated,frustrated,Why can't we just -- you know what?  How about if we just pretend that I'm getting a -- renewing my California I.D. and we just don't tell anybody -- That I'm getting a new one from a different state?
22,frustrated,frustrated,Sir please don't waste my time.
23,frustrated,frustrated,There is nothing I can do about it.  You need to take this other form and fill it out and go stand in the other line.
24,frustrated,frustrated,Come on!  You know -- you can't just take -- make a little exception to the rule?  I know that you guys make exceptions.  I see -- you know if I was-if I was your friend and you knew me or something like that you'd probably make a little exception for me wouldn't you?
25,frustrated,frustrated,They're different forms we process them all different-
26,angry,angry,Wouldn't you? Oh come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.
27,frustrated,frustrated,I -- there's no way I'd make an exception.
28,frustrated,frustrated,Sir don't patronize me.  I can't make an exception.  I don't- I don't have the power to do that.  It's a different form.
29,frustrated,frustrated,Shh...I know you've got the power to do that.
30,frustrated,frustrated,They're processed differently.
31,frustrated,frustrated,That's crap- You're crap.  I don't buy it.
32,frustrated,frustrated,Sir you're gonna have to go stand in the other line.
33,frustrated,frustrated,I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.  That's as simple as it is.  I'm not leaving this line until I get my new I.D.
34,angry,angry,I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.
35,frustrated,frustrated,Well then you're just gonna look stupid because I'm just waiting for an I.D. and you're gonna make security take me out because I want my I.D.
36,frustrated,frustrated,That's just dumb.
37,frustrated,frustrated,But you filled out the wrong form and you're in the wrong line and you're wasting both of our times.
38,frustrated,frustrated,I filled out the wrong form because they made me fill out the wrong form!
39,angry,angry,Well that's unfortunate sir.  You're gonna have to go stand in the other line now.
40,frustrated,frustrated,This is crap.  You know I don't even know why I'm in this state.  Screw California.  I'm out of here.
1,happy,happy,You're the only one I know who loves his parents.
2,happy,happy,I know.  It's going out of style isn't it?
3,happy,happy,No it's good.
4,happy,happy,It's so lovely here.  The air is sweet.
5,happy,happy,No.  But I'm not going to stay.
6,null,null,What?
7,sadness,sadness,Well sort of embarrassed soon as I came.
8,happy,happy,Well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so.  But uh- they take it for granted that we're all set.
9,null,null,How did you know?
10,null,null,Well from her point of view why else would I come?
11,happy,happy,I guess this is why I came.
12,happy,happy,Anne I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you!
13,excited,excited,I- I -I have no imagination that's all I know what to say I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different some place where we could be new to each other you know.
14,excited,excited,You feel it's wrong here don't you- this yard this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.
15,excited,excited,Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.
16,happy,happy,I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait so long?  All this time I've been wondering if I was a fool for thinking of you!
17,excited,excited,Oh Annie we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.
18,happy,happy,Not like that you're not.
19,happy,happy,Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you Chris.  Chris what's the matter?
20,sadness,sadness,Yeah I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.
21,sadness,sadness,It wouldn't work like this.
22,sadness,sadness,It's- It's mixed up with so many other things I-
23,sadness,sadness,Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.
24,null,null,yeah sure.
25,sadness,sadness,Yeah.  I lost them.
26,sadness,sadness,how many?
27,sadness,sadness,just about all.
28,sadness,sadness,Oh gee.
29,sadness,sadness,Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-
30,sadness,sadness,for instance there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know He just put them in my pocket.
31,sadness,sadness,I know that- that's not a big thing but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.
32,sadness,sadness,I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.
33,sadness,sadness,And I got an ideal watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-
34,sadness,sadness,but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time a kind of responsibility man for man.  Do you understand me?
35,sadness,sadness,And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.
36,sadness,sadness,And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.
37,sadness,sadness,It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad in that whole rat race again.
38,sadness,sadness,And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and
39,sadness,sadness,It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean you can take those things out of the war but if you drive that car you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!
40,null,null,Do you still feel like that?
41,excited,excited,I I want you now Annie.
42,sadness,sadness,Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris you hear me?  I mean everything that you have you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.
43,happy,happy,Oh Annie.  Annie I am going to make you a fortune!
44,happy,happy,What would I do with a fortune?
1,excited,excited,Okay so big news.

It's like L.A. is so frustrating because if you don't know somebody you can't -you can't get a job.  It's impossible.  It's totally discriminatory.  You have to know somebody.
9,null,null,Nothing's impossible.
10,frustrated,frustrated,It's not fair.

27,null,null,Have you?  There's got to be something else.
28,frustrated,frustrated,Three years of going out every day--every day--and looking for a job and being constantly denied everywhere I go.
29,frustrated,frustrated,I don't know what to tell you babe. Maybe- Maybe you're right.  Maybe you do have to go someplace else.  I don't know maybe it's just not meant to be here.  I mean I want you to-I don't want you to give up but I mean I don't want you to move away but at the same time I don't like seeing you like this.
30,sadness,sadness,I'm just so scared to start over I mean.  I put so much time and energy into being here.
31,sadness,sadness,Where am I supposed to go?  I mean like what?
32,null,null,If it's rent or something like that I mean I can help you out a little bit if- if that will help you you know stick with it.

34,null,null,Well just don't give up. And there's- you know You never know something might be around the corner tomorrow.
35,null,null,Well you know I'm not going to let you starve.
36,sadness,sadness,I'm just worried.
37,frustrated,frustrated,It's three years.
38,frustrated,frustrated,I understand but you know what you've been negative for three years.
39,null,null,It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything it's just that-
40,sadness,sadness,That's really hard to hear.
41,frustrated,frustrated,But it's true babe.  You've got to be more positive about things.  Like- Have some faith in yourself.
42,sadness,sadness,I feel like I have faith and now faith is running thin because there is no money.
43,null,null,Well exactly.  Money is not everything.
44,frustrated,frustrated,Brian I don't think you have a concept of what I mean by- by money.  I don't mean money like oh I can't go get my hair and my nails done today I mean like I can't eat.
45,frustrated,frustrated,You can.
46,null,null,You know I would never let that happen.  I wouldn't let that happen.

50,frustrated,frustrated,Yeah I don't intend to stop trying.  I just--I don't when is when enough is enough.
51,null,null,And you've got to think--well ask yourself why are they not hiring you?

60,frustrated,frustrated,Yeah I always think so but I- I just feel like it's a lot of lip service everywhere I go.
61,null,null,Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?
62,frustrated,frustrated,Yeah I follow up.
63,null,null,Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?

48,excited,excited,[LAUGHTER] Oh it'll be awesome that's for sure.
49,excited,excited,Uh huh it will be awesome.
50,excited,excited,Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.
51,excited,excited,living near the U.S.C. campus by myself not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad.
52,excited,excited,[LAUGHTER] by yourself.
53,excited,excited,you'd be that kid
54,excited,excited,living near campus and not going to school.
55,excited,excited,Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much.
56,excited,excited,[LAUGHTER]
57,excited,excited,Oh it's going to be so much fun.
58,excited,excited,yeah.
59,excited,excited,Well congratulations. and to me too because now I get to-have-

63,excited,excited,Tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow-
64,excited,excited,yeah.
65,excited,excited,Good.  We'll have to have one soon you're going to have to go to school in a couple of months.
66,excited,excited,Woo-
67,excited,excited,Oh God it's awesome... There's going to be tons of places. [garbage]
68,excited,excited,exciting.
1,excited,excited,Well so what do you think?
2,null,null,About what?
3,excited,excited,What I was just saying.
4,null,null,It's ridiculous.
5,frustrated,frustrated,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.
6,frustrated,frustrated,I'm sorry.  It's just it's it's just fish to me.
7,null,null,uh Carla Can I ask you a question?  no don't get upset but are you having your period?
8,angry,angry,God damn it Augie.  Seriously you always ask me that.  Why do you ask me that?  I hate it.  It's so insulting.
9,frustrated,frustrated,What's bugging you then?
10,frustrated,frustrated,I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.
11,frustrated,frustrated,It's not that complicated.  We come down here the grunions arrive they do their little fish thing.  We say ooh awe look at the little fish.  And then they go home and we go home.
12,frustrated,frustrated,We We don't ever.  Have we ever?
13,frustrated,frustrated,We've missed them twice.  That's hardly ever.
14,angry,angry,Twice is every time we've tried that's ever
15,angry,angry,No we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly my hands clasped neatly in front of me waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.
16,frustrated,frustrated,Okey They're just fish.  It's nothing to get traumatized over.
17,frustrated,frustrated,You don't understand anything I am saying.
18,frustrated,frustrated,No of course not.
19,sadness,sadness,I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.
20,frustrated,frustrated,I'm trying to work this backwards.  But I can't seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here.  Okay so --
21,frustrated,frustrated,you were fine on the phone call with Marge eating dinner was finetalking- uh washing the dishes no problem.  All right.  So I'm taking a shower you're watching TV the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say Great let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.  And so all right and I'm putting on my coat I'm putting out the animals I'm pulling the car out of the garage.
22,sadness,sadness,Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.
23,sadness,sadness,And I remember thinking to myself finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.
24,sadness,sadness,Dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle.
25,null,null,It was in the car right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that right?  You wanted it to be like it was before right?
26,sadness,sadness,I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.
27,sadness,sadness,No.
28,sadness,sadness,No.
29,sadness,sadness,No.
30,frustrated,frustrated,What you want me to blow in your ear?
31,frustrated,frustrated,Do you want to get married again?- What?  What do you want a divorce?
32,frustrated,frustrated,A vacation?
33,sadness,sadness,No.
34,frustrated,frustrated,A poodle a backrub a spa a suicide pack?  What Carla what the hell do you want?
35,sadness,sadness,I just want- I just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to.
36,angry,angry,Well welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?
37,angry,angry,Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think good God when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But ha ha baby the jokes on us!
38,angry,angry,Because you know what you get Carla?  You know what you get?  This.
39,frustrated,frustrated,Right.
40,sadness,sadness,But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.
41,sadness,sadness,Now I know.  Me either
42,sadness,sadness,This is just this.  I mean it's a lot and everything.  But it's not you know something else.  Am I making any sense?
43,sadness,sadness,I'm trying the best I can.
44,sadness,sadness,I know that Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special you know with the sand and the moon but.
45,sadness,sadness,But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.
46,sadness,sadness,Maybe if you're with somebody else too?
47,sadness,sadness,I didn't say that.
48,sadness,sadness,No I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.
49,sadness,sadness,For heavens sake Augie whatever I am doing I'd rather it be with you.
50,sadness,sadness,Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.
51,happy,happy,Actually now that you mention it no.  I don't.
52,happy,happy,I don't know.  I think this is a pretty good spot.  I mean look at the view of the moon from here.
53,happy,happy,Yes I did notice that.  It does look really beautiful over the water.  Big old white moon.
54,happy,happy,Oh well look what we've got here.
55,happy,happy,Well it isn't champagne.
56,happy,happy,No.  I'm beginning to think you might be right. I think  this might be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.
57,happy,happy,Or not.
58,happy,happy,Or not.
1,null,null,You knew there was nothing in that.
2,null,null,Only a trivial little broach.
3,null,null,You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
4,angry,angry,You must admit that he was in love with you wasn't he?
5,null,null,maybe just a little but--
6,angry,angry,You let him kiss you.  You said you did.
7,null,null,And what of it?
8,frustrated,frustrated,What of it?
9,null,null,Well I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.
10,angry,angry,Well that's a nice point of view I must say.
11,frustrated,frustrated,I'm growing quite tired and bored of this conversation.
12,null,null,So am I bored stiff.  Would you like some brandy?
13,null,null,I'll have a little I think.
14,null,null,I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.
15,null,null,Well it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.
16,null,null,It's becoming a habit with you.
17,angry,angry,You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.
18,angry,angry,Really Amanda.
19,null,null,Just making myself fascinating for you.
20,angry,angry,Oh that reply has broken my heart.
21,frustrated,frustrated,Oh yes it is.
22,angry,angry,It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
23,angry,angry,Um It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.
24,angry,angry,adder don't snap they sting.
25,angry,angry,They sting.
26,angry,angry,They snap.
27,angry,angry,I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops okay.
28,frustrated,frustrated,[BREATHING]
29,angry,angry,Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
30,null,null,Yes I did quite a bit.
31,angry,angry,I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.
32,angry,angry,Mind your own business.
33,angry,angry,You must have a riotous time no restraint at all very enjoyable.  I mean you never had much anyway.
34,angry,angry,Oh dear you really are becoming quite insufferable.  I would imagine it's because you're drunk.
35,frustrated,frustrated,Oh You are so insufferable.  Do you stop.
36,frustrated,frustrated,Oh This is very interesting.  We- we might get a splendid debate going about this intemperate tots.
37,angry,angry,Not very funny dear you better have some more brandy.
38,frustrated,frustrated,Ugh.
39,frustrated,frustrated,You better turn that off I think.
40,angry,angry,Why?
41,angry,angry,There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.
42,angry,angry,They're away in Tunis.
43,angry,angry,Turn it on again.
44,angry,angry,Fine if you insist on being completely insolent.
45,angry,angry,Turn it off.  It is driving me mad.
46,angry,angry,Well do try to control yourself darling.
47,angry,angry,Turn it off.
48,angry,angry,You really do need to develop uh a clearer head.
49,angry,angry,Turn it off.
50,angry,angry,I- I hate you.
51,angry,angry,Amanda-- Listen- Listen-
52,angry,angry,I hate you.
53,angry,angry,No no.  I'm tired of listening to you.  You're boorish and idiotic and completely overbearing.
54,angry,angry,Very music- amusing indeed.
55,angry,angry,Yeah very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.
56,angry,angry,You are a vile tempered loose living wicked little beast and I never want to set eyes on you again.
57,angry,angry,Oh marry you again?  I must have been insane.  What was I thinking?  I mean you're completely outrageous.
58,angry,angry,Shut up shut up.  I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee. You're a mean evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.
59,angry,angry,Beast; brute; cad; whore
1,excited,excited,What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  Oh this is great isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.  Actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people.  I was afraid we might miss it though so how are you doing?
2,sadness,sadness,Fine.
3,excited,excited,What's that? Is that- Wait is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it is it?  It will probably be unmistakable don't you think?
4,excited,excited,This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh no.  Oh do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.
5,null,null,What flashlight?
6,excited,excited,The flashlight.  The silver one.  There's only one isn't there?  Stupid.
7,excited,excited,Oh no of course our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight naturally.
8,excited,excited,How could we have forgotten it? Well I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember was the moon full last year do you remember?
9,excited,excited,Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket our blanket.  Oh this is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Oh a six pack would be just the ticket right about now.
10,excited,excited,I can't believe I forgot.I'm like a little kid.  I'm surprised I made it out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh [LAUGHTER]
11,excited,excited,Oh I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something
12,excited,excited,Do you want my jacket?
13,frustrated,frustrated,Oh
14,excited,excited,Honey it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.
15,excited,excited,I mean Think about people in Kansas they've got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's just too good of an opportunity to pass up.
16,frustrated,frustrated,Pass what up?  It's It's just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.
17,excited,excited,Yeah but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know
18,excited,excited,and all that about flopping around it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.
19,excited,excited,I mean this is a big night for these guys.  You know life's last orgy.
20,frustrated,frustrated,What are you so excited about.  This isn't rocket science this is just fish.  Fish nobody even eats.
21,frustrated,frustrated,Yeah they do.
22,frustrated,frustrated,Augie.
23,excited,excited,All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know I can't see how you could not be interested.
24,sadness,sadness,I'm just not.
25,frustrated,frustrated,For real?
26,frustrated,frustrated,I don't get it.  I mean the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life. And last year I remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didn't even notice until you got in the car.
27,frustrated,frustrated,Well if you also remember last year we- our shoes got wet I got sand in my panties we had a big argument you had a sore throat and we didn't see the grunion.
28,frustrated,frustrated,We didn't see them the first time either.
29,excited,excited,Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No that's seaweed.
30,excited,excited,Oh this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean think about this I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;
31,excited,excited,somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-
32,excited,excited,And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency it's pure urge.  I mean they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name
33,excited,excited,they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.
34,excited,excited,Well so what do you think?
1,sadness,sadness,What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.
2,sadness,sadness,When?  I was the first one up.  He was still in bed.  How could he have seen it?
3,sadness,sadness,Did you talk to him?
4,sadness,sadness,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
5,sadness,sadness,He cried hard?
6,frustrated,frustrated,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?
7,frustrated,frustrated,What do you want to do argue with him?
8,frustrated,frustrated,I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.
9,angry,angry,Why should he dream about him walking around looking for him at night?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had any hope for years now?
10,frustrated,frustrated,We have to say it to him.
11,frustrated,frustrated,how are you gonna prove it?  Can you prove it?
12,angry,angry,For Gods sake!  Three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  That's insane!
13,frustrated,frustrated,To you it is and to me but not to him.  Now you can talk yourself until you're blue in the face Chris but there's no body and there's no grave.  So where are you?
14,angry,angry,The trouble is the God damn newspapers.  I mean every every week a kid turns up missing like longer than Larry.
15,frustrated,frustrated,All right.  All right mom.  Just listen.  You know why I invited Annie her don't you?
16,null,null,You know.
17,null,null,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
18,frustrated,frustrated,It's not just my business.
19,angry,angry,Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.
20,frustrated,frustrated,So it's okay then?  I should just go ahead and do it?
21,angry,angry,Oh so it isn't just my business?
22,frustrated,frustrated,I'm just saying.
23,angry,angry,You infuriate me sometimes.  Do you know that?  God.
24,angry,angry,Isn't it your business too if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean you have such a talent for ignoring things.
25,angry,angry,I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean the girl is Larry's girl.
26,angry,angry,She is not Larry's girl!
27,angry,angry,From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now you can go on from there if you know where to go Chris but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?
28,frustrated,frustrated,I don't know why it is but everytime I reach out for something I- that I want I have to pull back because I might hurt somebody else.  My whole bloody life; time after time after time.
29,null,null,Well you're a considerate fella there's nothing wrong in that
30,angry,angry,To hell with that!
31,null,null,Have you asked Annie yet?
32,null,null,Well what if she feels like your father?  And how do you know she will marry you?
33,null,null,Well the trouble is you never saw enough women.
34,angry,angry,So what?  I'm not fast with women.
35,frustrated,frustrated,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.
36,frustrated,frustrated,Because it is.
37,frustrated,frustrated,Well that's a good reason.  But that doesn't mean anything at all.  I mean you haven't seen her in five years.
38,frustrated,frustrated,I know her best all right?  I don't know.  I grew up next to her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?
39,frustrated,frustrated,No.  I don't want a -- look your father thinks he's coming back Chris.  You marry that girl and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father; do you know?  Because I don't.
40,angry,angry,I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.
41,angry,angry,But if that can't happen I'll just have to get out.
42,angry,angry,I'll get out.  I'll go get married and live someplace else.  I don't know maybe New York.
43,angry,angry,Are you crazy?
44,angry,angry,I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.
45,angry,angry,Yes.  On this I would.
46,angry,angry,Well you help me stay here.
47,angry,angry,All right.  But don't think like that.  Because what the hell did we work for Chris?  I mean this whole thing it's all for you.
48,frustrated,frustrated,I know that mom.  Just you help me stay here.
49,angry,angry,Just don't think that way.  Do you hear me?
50,frustrated,frustrated,I don't understand you do I?
51,frustrated,frustrated,No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
52,frustrated,frustrated,Yeah I can see that.

45,angry,angry,Yeah meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.
46,frustrated,frustrated,That's what the cost of the ticket was for.
47,frustrated,frustrated,Ma'am international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-
48,angry,angry,Right but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.
49,frustrated,frustrated,Right. Yes ma'am.
50,angry,angry,And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.
51,frustrated,frustrated,Right and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage it is a fifty dollar voucher.
52,angry,angry,That's all you can offer me? I mean my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.
53,null,null,Well I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?
54,null,null,Well my hands are really tied then.
55,frustrated,frustrated,Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?
56,null,null,Well it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it then you get more. You know Like if you--
57,frustrated,frustrated,Right but if I'm riding a bus I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.
58,null,null,Well of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?
59,frustrated,frustrated,Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.
60,null,null,Uh so it was really heavy.
61,frustrated,frustrated,Well you know what it could still turn up but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.
62,frustrated,frustrated,There's nothing else you can do?
63,null,null,I'm sorry ma'am there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.
64,angry,angry,I don't believe that for a second.
65,null,null,Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.
66,frustrated,frustrated,Obviously I'm doing everything that I can here.
67,null,null,Well I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-
68,angry,angry,What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?
69,null,null,makes up?
70,angry,angry,You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-
71,null,null,The airline makes these rules mom ma'am.
72,frustrated,frustrated,So I'm just supposed to oh well oops my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?
73,frustrated,frustrated,Well you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does then we'll deliver it to you.
74,frustrated,frustrated,And you have no guarantee.
75,frustrated,frustrated,I have no guarantee absolutely not.
76,frustrated,frustrated,This is ridiculous.
77,frustrated,frustrated,How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?
78,frustrated,frustrated,Uh- Because you guys lost it so it should be your responsibility to find it too.
79,frustrated,frustrated,Right well when you're at home and you lose something do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?
80,frustrated,frustrated,Oh come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.
81,frustrated,frustrated,Well it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous
82,angry,angry,No I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.
83,null,null,Right.
84,angry,angry,It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.
85,frustrated,frustrated,I understand that ma'am but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.
86,null,null,And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now obviously I can't do that.
87,null,null,So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?
88,frustrated,frustrated,Yeah I'll take your fifty dollar voucher.
89,null,null,Okay just fill out these three forms and um- you'll- we'll have that sent to you within the next three weeks and of course we'll definitely keep an eye out for your bag.

4,frustrated,frustrated,No they told me-I'm sorry but they told me to be in this line.
5,frustrated,frustrated,What I mean what... what's the difference?  What do I need to do there that I can't do here?
6,null,null,Well I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place.
7,frustrated,frustrated,Can you just-can I just get the right-
8,frustrated,frustrated,Simply step to line two A ma'am I'm sorry.
9,frustrated,frustrated,Would you be able to put me at the front of that line?
10,frustrated,frustrated,There is a large line of people behind you waiting to be--
11,frustrated,frustrated,I know.  I've been in line with these people.  I understand.  I understand what it's like.  Could you please like call over and-
12,frustrated,frustrated,I don't want to be rude here ma'am but line two B is where you need to be.  This is the line for registration.
13,frustrated,frustrated,I hear that.  I hear that.  Thank you but I've waited in line for so long and I don't want to have to be here all day.
14,frustrated,frustrated,I don't have those-
15,null,null,So could I maybe get the form from you fill it out here- and maybe you could-
16,frustrated,frustrated,I don't have those forms ma'am.  I can't help you.  That's why you need to go to line two A.
17,frustrated,frustrated,And how long is that going to take?
18,frustrated,frustrated,Ma'am obviously I have no idea how long it's taking.  There seems to be a bit of a line there.  It looks like thirty forty people.  It could take four to five hours.  I'm sorry.
19,frustrated,frustrated,I don't-
20,frustrated,frustrated,There's nothing I can do for you ma'am.
21,frustrated,frustrated,I don't have time for this today and-
22,frustrated,frustrated,But obviously I don't have time for you to stand here and waste my time in this line.  There are other people who need service behind you who are waiting for the right things.
23,frustrated,frustrated,Is there anything you can do?  Please have some compassion.  Is there something you can do?
24,frustrated,frustrated,I am a very compassionate person and I'm offended that you imply that I'm not.  Of course I'm compassionate.  Look I work in the D.M.V..  What do you think I am?  Go wait in line two A.
25,frustrated,frustrated,Don't ask me to have somebody else come over here and move you myself.  I can't come back over there.  I'll get security if you need me to.
26,frustrated,frustrated,Please I don't think that's necessary.  I'm just asking maybe you could call over and say that somebody miss informed her because I didn't pick to stand in this line.  I asked them where to stand and they told me here.
27,frustrated,frustrated,what no I'm sure they did not tell you here.
28,frustrated,frustrated,No they did.  The lady over there told me to stand in this line and I've been here for an hour.

30,frustrated,frustrated,No.
31,frustrated,frustrated,No I'm not I'm sorry.I'm not stupid.
32,frustrated,frustrated,I'm not saying that you're stupid ma'am.  I think you just said that you were stupid.
33,angry,angry,Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.
34,frustrated,frustrated,It doesn't work that way here ma'am.
35,angry,angry,Why not?
36,frustrated,frustrated,There is a strict system here.  You need to wait in the right line for the right thing.  This is the line for registration.
37,frustrated,frustrated,Except they're going tell are you going to tell me the right line to stand in this time at least?
38,frustrated,frustrated,I told you it was line two A.
39,angry,angry,Right well last time they told me it was this line and obviously it's not true.
40,frustrated,frustrated,I don't know who told you that but they were wrong.  I'm sorry.
41,frustrated,frustrated,Do you have a manager I could speak with?
42,frustrated,frustrated,Are you being straight with me?
43,frustrated,frustrated,I'm being very straight with you ma'am.  There is nothing I can do for you.  You need to stand in line two A.
44,frustrated,frustrated,Fine.
1,null,null,Why does that bother you?
2,null,null,Well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her again.
3,null,null,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.
4,frustrated,frustrated,What are you talking about?  He grew up next to the girl his whole life why wouldn't he want to see her again?  Don't look at me like that.  He hasn't told me anything he didn't told you.
5,null,null,Why do you think he's even thinking that?

9,happy,happy,Oh Chris I've been ready for a long time.
10,sadness,sadness,I almost got married two years ago.
11,happy,happy,You felt something that far back?
12,happy,happy,Everyday since.

22,sadness,sadness,You have to tell me.
23,null,null,I don't I don't know where to start.
24,sadness,sadness,It wouldn't work like this.
25,sadness,sadness,It's so mixed up with so many other things.
26,null,null,Yeah sure.
27,sadness,sadness,I lost them.
28,sadness,sadness,How many?
29,sadness,sadness,Just about all.
30,sadness,sadness,It- It takes time to toss something like that offI mean because they weren't just men.
31,sadness,sadness,I know it's it's just a little thing but that's just the kind of guys I had.  They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.
32,sadness,sadness,I mean that exactly anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.
33,sadness,sadness,It was and then I went home.  And it was incredible.  It didn't have any meaning there.
34,sadness,sadness,I felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.
35,frustrated,frustrated,It seemed to make suckers out of so many guys.  And I-I felt wrong to be alive; to to open that bank book to to drive that car the new car and look at that new refrigerator. I mean
36,frustrated,frustrated,you can take those things out of the war but if you're gonna drive that car you've got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man. And you've got to be a little bit better because of that.  Because if you're not then it's all just loot and there's blood on it and I didn't want any of it.
37,sadness,sadness,And I guess that included you.
38,sadness,sadness,Do you still feel like that?
39,sadness,sadness,I want you now Annie.
40,sadness,sadness,Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris.  Because everything you have you have a right to me included.
41,excited,excited,Oh Annie

43,happy,happy,Annie I am going to make you a fortune.
1,null,null,Only a trivial little broach.
2,null,null,Not at all.  I quite like it.  I wear it often.
3,frustrated,frustrated,[garbage] No I didn't.  You worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.
4,frustrated,frustrated,You must admit that he was in love with you. wasn't he?
5,null,null,Oh maybe a little.  Nothing serious.
6,frustrated,frustrated,He let him kiss you.  You said you did.
7,null,null,Well what of it.
8,null,null,Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.
9,angry,angry,Well that's a nice point of view I must say.
10,frustrated,frustrated,I'm getting very bored with this conversation.
11,angry,angry,Me too bored stiff.
12,null,null,Do you want some brandy?
13,null,null,No thanks.
14,null,null,I think I'll have a little.
15,null,null,It's becoming a habit with you.

22,angry,angry,No it it is not be quiet.
23,angry,angry,It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.
24,frustrated,frustrated,Nonsense they've got a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap!
25,frustrated,frustrated,They sting.
26,angry,angry,They snap.
27,null,null,So did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?
28,null,null,Yes I did quite a lot.
29,angry,angry,You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then huh?
30,angry,angry,I'm sure you had a riotous time no restrain at all very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.
31,frustrated,frustrated,You're quite insufferable.  I do imagine it's because you're drunk.
32,angry,angry,I am not the slightest bit drunk.
33,null,null,You always had a weak head.
34,angry,angry,I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.
35,angry,angry,Oh really?  How about a child of three or child of six what about a child of nine?
36,angry,angry,Not- Would you shut up.
37,angry,angry,You know we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.
38,frustrated,frustrated,You're not very funny dear.  You better have some more brandy.
39,angry,angry,You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.
40,angry,angry,You better turn that off I think.
41,angry,angry,Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.
42,angry,angry,Well there are people downstairs I suppose.
43,angry,angry,This is no time of the year for Tunis.
44,angry,angry,I do I shall do no such thing.
45,angry,angry,Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.
46,angry,angry,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.
47,angry,angry,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.
48,angry,angry,Turn it off!
49,angry,angry,Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.
50,angry,angry,Very amusing indeed.
51,angry,angry,You know what I'm sick and tire of listening to you.  You're a-- You're a total sadistic bully.
52,angry,angry,Ja! Very funny.
53,angry,angry,Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean you're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.
54,angry,angry,You are a vile tempered wicked living evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.
55,angry,angry,This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.
56,angry,angry,Oh you're not going like this.
57,angry,angry,Yes I am. Let go with me
58,angry,angry,[GARBAGE] No you're not.
59,angry,angry,You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God never!
60,angry,angry,oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.
61,angry,angry,Beast

7,sadness,sadness,You know he was gonna and we -- all the way up to the end we were just talking about how- you know all the stuff we were gonna do and you know.  When he finally kicked this stupid cancer you know and we were gonna --
8,sadness,sadness,he wanted to travel you know.  And he's so talented.  Probably the most talented person I have ever met in my entire life.
9,sadness,sadness,What did he do?
10,sadness,sadness,He was a designer you know.  But he did everything. You know He painted and he- and he did costume design he did set design he did lighting he was --
11,sadness,sadness,he just did everything.  He was literally literally the most talented guy I have ever met in my entire life.
12,sadness,sadness,And he's gone now and I  -- I just can't believe it.
13,sadness,sadness,Yeah.  I'm so sorry.
14,sadness,sadness,I mean one second you think you know you're just having a conversation and then --
15,sadness,sadness,you know sometimes you think you want to make that phone call or you think you want to tell somebody something or something like that.  Do you know what I mean?  Like that's -- he was the person that I did that with.  You know like that's the person who I needed to call to tell things to all the time.
16,sadness,sadness,You guys have been-
17,sadness,sadness,And now I don't have that person anymore you know.  And it's -- -- it's just you.
18,sadness,sadness,You think that things get easier you know as you as you get older and you -
19,sadness,sadness,and it just gets worse.  It just gets worse everything is bad all the time; people die your friends die family dies your best friends die. it's-
20,sadness,sadness,I'm sorry. I-
21,sadness,sadness,You always think you know when you were- you know when you were a little kid and you think something is gonna happen like it will all be better when I am older you know?
22,sadness,sadness,Wow Ryan I know that you are hurting right now but I don't think you always feel like that.
23,sadness,sadness,No you're right.  I don't.  You're right.
24,sadness,sadness,Even yeah -- he doesn't he would never feel that way he would never want me to feel that way.  Of course not but that's just where I am right now and -- -- I don't know what else to do with it.
25,sadness,sadness,Yeah. I understand.  I think it's really healthy to grieve.
26,sadness,sadness,I just miss him.
27,sadness,sadness,If there's anything I can do to be there for you.
28,sadness,sadness,Thanks.
1,sadness,sadness,What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.
2,sadness,sadness,He was out here when it broke.
3,sadness,sadness,About four this morning.  I heard it crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right there when it cracked.
4,sadness,sadness,I don't know.  But after he saw it he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.
5,sadness,sadness,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.
6,sadness,sadness,Yes yes he is.  I don't know the meaning in it.  But I know one thing mom we made a terrible mistake with Dad.
7,frustrated,frustrated,I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time that he knows that nobody else believes that Larry's alive. I mean
8,frustrated,frustrated,Why shouldn't he dream about him walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for a long time?
9,frustrated,frustrated,For Gods sake three years!  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane!
10,frustrated,frustrated,The trouble is the God damn newspapers I mean ea- each week a new boy turns up out of nowhere.  So the next one is gonna be Larry.  So you--
11,frustrated,frustrated,All right.  All right just listen.
12,frustrated,frustrated,You know it's not just my business.
13,frustrated,frustrated,What do you want me to do?  I mean You're old enough to know your own mind.
14,frustrated,frustrated,So it's all right then?  I should just go ahead with it?
15,angry,angry,Isn't it your business too if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.
16,frustrated,frustrated,I ignore what I got to ignore.  I mean the girl is Larry's girl.
17,angry,angry,She's not Larry's girl.
18,frustrated,frustrated,I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something that I want I have to pull back because it might hurt somebody else my whole bloody life time after time after time.
19,angry,angry,what to hell with that!
20,null,null,Have you asked Annie yet?
21,null,null,Well how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels like your father does.
22,frustrated,frustrated,I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with dad all right?  Mom don't avoid me.
23,null,null,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.
24,frustrated,frustrated,So what I'm not fast with women?
25,frustrated,frustrated,Because it is.
26,null,null,Well that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.
27,frustrated,frustrated,[garbage] I don't know.  It's just
28,frustrated,frustrated,she's who I know best. I know her since I- I was a kid I grew up with her.  When I think of somebody for my wife these days I I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?
29,frustrated,frustrated,No I don't want a-  Your father thinks he's coming back Chris.  If you marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.
30,sadness,sadness,Now what's going to happen to your father do you know?  I don't.
31,frustrated,frustrated,All right then mom.
32,angry,angry,I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.
33,angry,angry,But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.
34,angry,angry,I'll get out.  I'll go get married someplace else I- I'll live someplace else maybe New York.
35,angry,angry,Are you crazy?
36,angry,angry,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.
37,angry,angry,Must you be inspired?
38,angry,angry,Yeah I'd like one hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long I'd like to go home to something beautiful.  I'd like a family.  I'd like some kids.
39,angry,angry,You don't want to think like that.
40,frustrated,frustrated,All right.  But don't think like that because what the hell did we work for Chris?  All of this all of it it's all just for you.
41,frustrated,frustrated,I know that mom.  Just you help me stay here.
42,angry,angry,Well I am thinking like that.
43,frustrated,frustrated,I don't understand you do I?
44,angry,angry,No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.
1,null,null,What is it?
2,sadness,sadness,um.
3,sadness,sadness,I'm sorry.  It's just a lot ahh to explain. ahh I got a call--
4,sadness,sadness,I got a call today
5,sadness,sadness,I'm going to need to go overseas for a while.
6,angry,angry,You got called up.
7,angry,angry,I thought you said this wasn't going to happen for at least a year.
8,frustrated,frustrated,What am I going to do?
9,sadness,sadness,I don't know "sigh".
10,frustrated,frustrated,The kids-
11,sadness,sadness,I know.  I know.
12,sadness,sadness,I know.  Well we'll have to figure all that out.  I mean I think the Army's going to provide childcare and help us out with that. um.
13,angry,angry,Where do you have to go?  Where are you going?
14,sadness,sadness,Iraq.
15,sadness,sadness,I think infantry.  I'm not sure.
16,frustrated,frustrated,It's going to be at least six months probably a year. I tried.
17,angry,angry,I don't understand why they would just do something like this?
18,frustrated,frustrated,I know I know.  It's really really messed up.
19,angry,angry,It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.
20,frustrated,frustrated,I don't know I don't know what I'm going to do.  I don't know how to-
21,frustrated,frustrated,Well maybe you should move in with my mom and she can help.
22,frustrated,frustrated,I don't know I'm just--I'm trying to think of something.
23,frustrated,frustrated,You can't what?
24,sadness,sadness,I don't think there's anything we can do.
25,sadness,sadness,I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.
26,sadness,sadness,It's not fair.
27,sadness,sadness,I know.  I know it's not fair.
28,sadness,sadness,Why has to be you?  There's all those other people.  Somebody else can go instead.  It's not right.
29,sadness,sadness,Well apparently nobody else can go.
30,frustrated,frustrated,I don't know.  Baby why are you asking me this?  It's just as hard for me.  Please try to understand that.
31,frustrated,frustrated,I understand baby.  I'm sorry. I mean try to understand I'm I'm scared myself.
32,sadness,sadness,I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you.
33,sadness,sadness,I know.
34,sadness,sadness,I know.
35,sadness,sadness,I jus-
36,sadness,sadness,We'll figure something out.  We just have to ... we just have to think about this.  Could any of your family help us?
37,sadness,sadness,I don't know.
38,sadness,sadness,Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know what they're going to say.
39,sadness,sadness,Yeah we'll call them.  We'll figure something out.  I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry.  You're right.
40,sadness,sadness,I'm going to miss their first words.
41,sadness,sadness,I know.
42,sadness,sadness,You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday.
43,sadness,sadness,All the time every day every day.  They have e-mail over there and stuff like that right? I can send you pictures.
44,sadness,sadness,Yeah as much as I can.
45,sadness,sadness,"sigh" Three weeks.

49,sadness,sadness,I love you.  I'm going to miss you so much. "sigh"
1,null,null,Why does that bother you?
2,null,null,She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?
3,null,null,Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.
4,null,null,What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that he didn't tell me any more than he told you.
5,frustrated,frustrated,How do you know he is even thinking about it?
6,frustrated,frustrated,Well so what.
7,frustrated,frustrated,What's going on here Joe?
8,frustrated,frustrated,Now listen Kate just-
9,angry,angry,She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.
10,frustrated,frustrated,She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.
11,frustrated,frustrated,How do you know why she's waited?
12,frustrated,frustrated,Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.
13,frustrated,frustrated,Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?
14,frustrated,frustrated,Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might but not his father and not his brother.
15,frustrated,frustrated,What do you want me to do? What do you want--
16,angry,angry,I want you to pretend like he's coming back!
17,frustrated,frustrated,But Kate...
18,angry,angry,Because if he's not coming back then I'll kill myself.
19,frustrated,frustrated,[LAUGHTER]
20,angry,angry,Laugh.  Laugh at me but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces?
21,frustrated,frustrated,Calm yourself.
22,frustrated,frustrated,Calm yourself!
23,angry,angry,Only last week another boy turned up in Detroit been missing longer than Larry you read it yourself.
24,frustrated,frustrated,All right all right.  Calm yourself.
25,sadness,sadness,You've got to believe. You've got to--
26,angry,angry,What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!
27,angry,angry,I can't help it!
28,angry,angry,What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?
